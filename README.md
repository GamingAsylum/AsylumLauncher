# Gaming Asylum Launcher

Welcome to the Gaming Asylum Launcher, a simple tool designed to enhance your gaming experience on our Arma 3 Life server. This launcher is crafted with the aim to expedite the downloading process of our mission files while minimizing the strain on our server's network.

## Why Gaming Asylum Launcher?

Downloading the mission file after an update can be slow, often taking a long time and slowing the server down at the same time? Here's where the launcher comes in:

- **Fast Downloads**: The Launcher downloads the latest mission file for you and lets you join right away
  
- **Server-Friendly**: Unlike the traditional method of downloading directly through Arma 3, The launcher downloads the mission file from a standalone server, alleviating any extra load on the life server.
